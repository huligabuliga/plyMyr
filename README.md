# plyMyr

From scratch start again October..

# 1st avance 22-24 oct:
reset project because antlr did not work and i could not figure it out... changing to ply restarted 22 october
pip install ply and started writing some tokens.
Lexer and Parser working, seems promising, can do sample 1 parse successful and tokens generated.
